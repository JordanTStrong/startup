## Elevator Pitch
For years, consumers all around the world have benefited from massive changes to the package delivery system. Amazon in particular revolutionized the industry, allowing consumers to 
get products the same day they found them online. Huge profit and consumer benefit was generated. Before long, other companies begain improving their delivery systems too. Getting 
packages delivered to your hosue is no longer a problem. Now, perhaps an even more tedious problem confronts the consumer - returns. Simply put, shopping is fun, returns are not. 
There is a massive need for consumers to be able to return their packages as quickly, efficiently, and easily as they purchased them. This is where Strong Returns comes in. Strong 
Returns connects a customer with a Strong Returns verified driver who will return packages for the customer. Simply logon, say how many boxes you have, and Strong Returns will take 
care of it for you.

## Key Features

Schedule. Users will use this to schedule when they would like for a driver to pick up their returns (or even select pick up ASAP!).
Previous items. Users will be able to see a clear history of every package they have ever returned with Strong Returns.
