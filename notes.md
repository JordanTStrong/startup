I learned that I need to be careful not to push my .pem to my public repository

# **SIMON**
I learned that the terminal is extremely powerful. Being able to make changes to my website via the terminal is amazing. I was also surprised at how straightforward HTML is. I had the preconveived notion that HTML would prove very difficult.
