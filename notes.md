# **GITHUB ASSIGNMENT**
I learned some basics about GitHub. I will access the terminal through VSCode in the future.

# **HTTPS**
I learned that I need to be careful not to push my .pem to my public repository

# **SIMON**
I learned that the terminal is extremely powerful. Being able to make changes to my website via the terminal is amazing. I was also surprised at how straightforward HTML is. I had the preconveived notion that HTML would prove very difficult.

Specifically, I learned:
- How to undo a git commit
- How to add pages to my website

# **STARTUP**
- Learned how to copy .sh file to my own repository
- Learned how to structure an HTML page
- Learned that index.html is normally the start/landing page label for html file
- Learned that I need to reference JS and CSS files from within the HTML file
- Learned that I can reference files that do not currently exist
- Learned that I can reference multiple HTML files to each other
- Learned that I can affect font size/bold or not 
- Learned that I can require data entry from a user to submit a form within HTML
- Learned how to link an image
- Learned how to create a button
- Learned that deployFiles.sh auto-populates the new HTML files. As in I don't need to replace the "startup" tag at the end of the command with any new file/page names. I assume that's handled dynamically by the deployFiles.sh script. Need to research further

**SIMON-CSS**
- Learned that referencing the css file is what gives it style
- Learned that can reference multiple css files
- Learned that I could break down very complex style requirements into multiple css files 
- Learned how to add style to my HTML
- Learned that there are technically ways to add style to HTML without having a separate css file, but that css is still best practice for my purposes

# **MIDTERM**
- I can use this CSS to load fonts from Google: @import url('https://stuffhere');
- Style element always used to hold css inside of HTML doc. Style is a container
- padding, CSS property, adds space around contents of selected elements

  - ITS ACTUALLY FISH AND RAT

  - document.querySelector('p') selects the first <p> element it finds in the document. It does not select all <p> elements. If you have multiple <p> elements in your document, this line of code will only attach the event listener to the very first one.
